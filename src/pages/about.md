# Tubby Cat Games

## A Philadelphia Game Studio

Tubby Cat Games, LLC. was formed in 2018 by Phil Simmons, in a naive failed attempt
to get a PS4 dev kit to experiment with.

Since then, we have created a series of experimental games and small side projects,
taken part in game jams with Philly's excellent indie and hobbyist community,
and helped organize events for local game developers.

Upcoming projects include a full listing and central access hub for past creations and accompanying source code, as well as a blog detailing our dev experiences.

We are also currently working on our first full Android and iOS game release, with
a plan to ship by summer 2020!
