# What is Tubby Cat Games?

Tubby Cat Games is an independent video game studio formed in the mid 2000s
by Phil Simmons.

It started out as a Sole-Proprietorship and evolved into an LLC in an ill-fated
effort to get a PS4 dev kit.

We are currently working on an accessible, open-source game called Reactional.

We also take part in organizing events for and participating in the local Philadelphia
game development community.

## Values

Tubby Cat Games holds the following to be paramount values for the studio to
run by.

These are open to discussion and change over time but should always be design to
improve the experiences of players and developers.

### Accessibility

Games should be made accessible and available to the widest base of players.

Adding accessibility should be thought of as a way to enhance experiences for
all players.

We will give priority to adding new accessibile options as they are brought
to our knowledge, and designing with an accessibility-first approach.

### Openness

By sharing knowledge and information we all benefit.

As much code as is viable will be made open source. Blog posts, code breakdown
and other educational methods will be employed to make code
understandable.

We will accept criticism openly, and attempt to address any concerns.

Financial openness will be prioritized for both internal and external
stakeholders.

### Responsibility

Games have an amazing potential for creating both joy and pain.

We should always address if an action may do harm to players.

Financial gain should not be used as a justification for doing harm.

If you have a one in a million chance of doign harm with an action, and
3 million players, you will have harmed 3 people.

### Sharability

Gaming experiences can be deeping personal, but should be able to be shared
withothers.

Adding Social Integration is not only a marketing tool, but also a way to allow
players to express themselves, avoid isolation and share in their interests
and experiences.

### Craftsmanship

Expedience should not be used as an excuse for sloppy work.

Best practices should be prioritized as they save time in the long run and
ensure a better product for ourselves and others.
