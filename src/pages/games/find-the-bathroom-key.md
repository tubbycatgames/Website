Find the Bathroom Key came out of a constant problem at my previous job.
People would take the bathroom keys home or leave them at their desk,
and then nobody could use the bathroom any more until at least one was
returned.

I proposed an alternative explanation to the missing keys,
a gremlin who broke in at night to steal them!

Created with the spirit of a game jam.

I limited myself to a week when I was on call at Vistar Media and was
allowed to work on a work adjacent side project when not dealing with
support issues.

A not-to-scale-but-inspired level based on the old Vistar Media offices.

My first game created with Unity that was beyond the scope of a tutorial.
