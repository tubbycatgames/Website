Identity Crisis was created for the [2018 ADL Game Jam](http://jams.gamejolt.io/adljam) for the theme of Identity.

It was organized by [Rachel Sima](https://rachelsima.com/) and hosted by [Drexel University](https://drexel.edu/), and was my first in-person game jam I took part in!

The team I ended up joining was comprised mostly of artists and writers who wanted to create a visual novel.  We chose [TyranoBuilder](https://tyranobuilder.com/) as the tool to create the game in as it was specialized for creating visual novels.

Identity Crisis is a short visual novel where a player wakes up in a new
city, and meets a variety of different people who are facing different
struggles, and tries to learn and grow along the way.

Working in Tyranobuilder was interesting because it was my first time
working with a mostly visual programming environment.  It has a simple
interface and built-in components for most of the things you would
need in a graphical environment.

The biggest issue I ended up having was that its conditional branching
logic was entirely built around the visual equivalent of a
[Goto statement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goto)
which is something that I was tought in school to be a
[dangerous tool](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goto#Criticism)
but had never dealt with it directly.

In the course of developing the game the various jumps became unweildy and
difficult to reason about.  I understand that they are useful in the case of
visual novels because you may need wildly branching and interleaving
narrative, but working with it still gave me a deeper appreciation of
[if statements](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conditional_(computer_programming)#If%E2%80%93then(%E2%80%93else)).
